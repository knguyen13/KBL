## Project test

Breakout board for the stm32l0 mcu.

***Brief***
Made for testing the STM32L011F3P6 chip.

***Design***
An stm32l0, in 20TSSOP package, has it's pins connected to two 10-pin headers. These headers are conveniently spaced to fit a standard breadboard.
The breakout board is very minimal; containing 1 power switch, 1 reset switch, 1 led, and a 20-pin header for flashing firmware.

***Wishlist***
    - Hardware Upgrades:
        1. Replace 20-pin header with tag-connect to reduce space.
